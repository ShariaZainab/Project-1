                M. Tech (Software Engineering) Software Engineering is applying engineering techniques to optimize the development of software. With the rapid adoption of Information Technology, the demand for software development has increased many-fold. A Master degree in Software Engineering prepares students to optimize this huge industry. In this two year program, students from basic undergraduate level engineering apply the aspects of software development with a set of best practices that can be used by a variety of industries resulting in simpler, better performing and more usable software.
                <br>
                The core purpose of M.Tech in Software Engineering is to foster state-of the-art in Software Engineers and to transition this work to the community by producing the best software professionals.
                <br>
                This degree provides students with the theoretical foundations of Software Engineering, experience in team projects involving software development and management, hands-on experience with state-of-the-art tools, an understanding of advanced software development and management techniques, and exposure to the most recent developments.
                <br>
                The Computer Science & Engineering department has set up advanced laboratory facilities and the students are trained in these laboratories regularly by allotting suitable time slots in the regular time table. Students have access to high speed broad band internet connection and a well equipped department library. The main library and department library has on- line access to IEEE Journals and magazines. Students are encouraged to participate in national level conferences & present papers.
                <br>
                Computer Science Engineering is a specialized discipline that combines electrical engineering and computer science. A computer science engineer is an electrical engineer with a focus on computer technology and power electronics. Hence it is a combination of these two disciplines with some transaction in between. Hence a CSE graduate may be considered as a software engineer with a focus on the relations between software programs and the underlying hardware technology.
                <br>
                To augment professional competence, the department supports in outside talents to gain more inputs, organizes periodical symposia and workshops not only to offer a newer dimension to the learning process but also infuse leadership qualities in the budding engineers.
